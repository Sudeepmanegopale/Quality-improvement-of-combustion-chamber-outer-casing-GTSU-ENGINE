# Quality-improvement-of-combustion-chamber-outer-casing-GTSU-ENGINE

Conducted a quality improvement project on the Combustion Chamber Outer Casing (CCOC) for the GTSU engine at Acharya Institute of Technology, Bangalore. The project focused on reducing residual stress, vibration, and operational cycle time while enhancing combustion efficiency. Utilizing methodologies such as literature review and root cause analysis, innovative solutions were implemented, including vertical turning centers and new fixtures, resulting in precise geometrical tolerances. This effort successfully reduced production time and costs, leading to increased overall efficiency and productivity. Collaborated with a team under expert guidance, contributing to a successful project outcome in aeronauticalÂ engineering.
